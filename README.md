LightsaberProject
=================

This project is a dream come true for any Star Wars fan. With Teensy 3.1 microcontroller serving as its heart, this lightsaber is a really cool and interactive toy. And building it was just as much fun as using it!

Short description of what the lightsaber can do:
The lightsaber will gradually turn on/off when the red button is pressed. It emits 'saber-like' sounds. The tone will alter depending on how fast you wave the weapon. Unfortunately,t doesn't cut (like the lightsabers from the movies) - I am still working on that feature :P

Elements used to build the lighsaber:
* Teensy 3.1 microcontroller
* three-axis, ultra-high performance digital accelerometer BMA180
* over 40 light-emitting diodes
* a few resistors
* small speaker
* on/off button
* loads of short cables
* battery set (AAA type)
* tube made of  Poly(methyl methacrylate) also known as 'acrylic glass'
* duct tape (two kinds: black and grey)

In this repo, you'll find a source code that runs on my Teensy (logic of the lightsaber), a schema of the electronic circuit and some pictures of my 'masterpiece' ;)
